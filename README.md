# dPOWToNBSCostTracking
An example of how to open a dPOW file that has been exported from the NBS BIM Toolkit and export deliverables to an NBS Cost Tracking file using [Xbim.Exchanger](https://github.com/theNBS/XbimExchange).

You will need [NBS Tools](http://www.thenbs.com/downloads/index.asp "NBS Tools") installed in order to open the .sdlx output file.
